This is an experiment for a note-taking system.

Goals:

- Serverless/Private. The data stays on your computer (either in browser session or on disk)
- Notes can have deadlines. While this is nothig new, deadlines can be `None` (constantly remind), on a `Date`, and `Periodic`, such as "Take the trash out every Wednesday. Notes will shift priorities in respect to their `Deadline`.
